Hi Lea. I am very sorry for the late in response. I am just coming in from a farmers conference which took the whole day away from me. 

You are a beautiful woman and i would like to know more about you. I am single and have been divorced for the past 8 years. I am a farmer and own 4,600 acres of land here in Kansas.

Are you French or Swiss? 

Well, a little about me, single, divorced and have a 23 years old daughter, Emily. We live together our our dogs. I like to adventure, travel for fun and meet different people from different backgrounds, cooking, hunting and fishing, gardening and listening to music. I have been married only once and looking to meet someone not like my ex, lol;

Tell me about your interest and hobbies. Ask anything you like to know about me. Once again sorry for the late in response and thanks for the pictures.
